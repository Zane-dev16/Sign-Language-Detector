# Sign Language Detection and Translation Project

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a full-stack data science application capable of real-time sign language detection using a webcam. The project aims to translate the detected sign language gestures into text or spoken language. The objectives include:

1. **Sign Language Recognition:** Implement a computer vision system to detect and interpret sign language gestures captured through the webcam.
2. **Translation Capability:** Convert the recognized sign language into text.
3. **Deployment:** Develop and Deploy web interface for users to interact with the sign language detection and translation system.

## Current Status

### Overall Progress:
- **Planning Phase:** Defined project objectives and initial architecture.

## Next Steps
- **Model Development:** Begin building and training computer vision models for sign language recognition.
- **Integration:** Connect the backend model with the frontend UI for real-time detection and translation.
- **Testing and Validation:** Perform extensive testing to ensure accurate detection and translation of sign language gestures.

## Libraries Used
- **TensorFlow:** Deep learning framework used for building and training machine learning models.
- **OpenCV:** Computer vision library used for image and video processing.
